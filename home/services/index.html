</h1>
</header>
<div class=entry-content>
<p>An alternative dispute resolution process for separating or separated parents to help
facilitate the best interests of the child.</p>
<p>Parenting coordination is a quasi-legal, alternative dispute resolution process. The aim
is to help separating or separated parents understand the best interests of their children
and work together to achieve them. Parenting coordination combines assessment, education,
case management and mediation. A parenting coordinator may also assist with decision making
when so ordered by the court. Parenting coordination is child-focused and oriented to serve
the best interests of the child or children. The objective of parenting coordination is to
assist in the implementation of a parenting plan, monitor compliance with the plan, help
resolve conflicts in a timely and cost effective manner, and to facilitate safe, healthy
and meaningful parent-child relationships. The duties of a parent coordinator include
providing parents with problem solving and conflict management services, monitoring
compliance with court orders, and providing parents, attorneys, and the court with
recommendations for new or modified parenting time provisions or mental health interventions.</p>
<p>Dr. Freedman applies his extensive background and training in forensic psychology,
family law, mediation, child development and the effects of divorce to the field of
parenting coordination. Parent coordination differs from psychotherapy and mediation:
there is no therapist/client privilege, the process is not confidential, and medical
insurance will not reimburse for parenting coordination.</p>

</h1>
</header>
<div class=entry-content>
<p>Consultation to attorneys and mental health professionals to address questions that pertain to the interaction of psychology and the legal system.</p>
<p>For example, Dr. Freedman consults with mental health professionals to prepare for testimony or deposition, respond to subpoenas and court orders or understand their role in legal proceedings. Dr. Freedman frequently consults with attorneys who believe that their client or case may involve a mental health issue. Such consultation may be helpful in determining the possible need for some form of forensic evaluation, to assist the attorney in most effectively representing their client or understanding their client’s needs. Dr. Freedman also consults with attorneys regarding psychological evaluations previously conducted by other psychologists. This type of consultation may be helpful in preparing for trial, considering a second opinion evaluation or understanding the opinions contained in the initial evaluation.</p>
