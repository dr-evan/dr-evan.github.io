Dr. Freedman was Board Certified in Forensic Psychology by the American Board of Professional Psychology (ABPP) in 2014. He is among approximately 300 Board Certified Forensic Psychologists in the United States who have been certified by ABPP. He is also a Fellow of the American Academy of Forensic Psychology (AAFP). Of the ten Board Certified Forensic Psychologists in the State of Washington, Dr. Freedman is the only person practicing in Whatcom and Skagit counties and one of the few who specializes in family law.

Board Certification by the ABPP is recognized as the highest standard of professional competence in forensic psychology. Board certification as a Forensic Psychologist is a process which requires years of post-doctoral study, extensive work product review by a panel of experts as well as written and oral examinations. The diploma awarded by the American Board of Professional Psychology (ABPP) is the only post-doctoral specialty certification recognized in the American Psychological Association Directory.

Board Certification in Forensic Psychology from ABPP indicates that an established organization of experts has examined Dr. Freedman and recognized him to be at the highest level of competence in the field of forensic psychology. The ABPP diploma has been recognized as the standard of professional competence in forensic psychology in judicial decisions, regulations, and statutes in certain jurisdictions. Consumers benefit from being educated when choosing providers of forensic psychological services. Some mental health professionals offer forensic psychological services with insufficient training. Others may not even be aware that their work is of a forensic nature or understand the rigor and legal standards which form the foundation for competent forensic psychological services. Additionally there are a number of “vanity” boards which provide “board certification” with limited standards or evaluative procedures. Psychologist expert witnesses who present themselves as “Board Certified” by bodies other than the American Board of Professional Psychology may be discredited during cross-examination.
