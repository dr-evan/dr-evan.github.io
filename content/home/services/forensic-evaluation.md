## Parental Capacity/Child Protection<span id="Parental-Capacity/Child-Protection">HelloWorld</span>
Evaluations of parental capacity are most commonly requested by case workers from the Division of Children and Family Services (DCFS) or the Washington State Attorney General’s office. Such evaluations provide opinions to the court to assist in decision making around a person’s parental capacity and the best psychological interests of their child. Parents referred for such evaluations have often been alleged to have abused, abandoned or neglected their children or to have mental health and/or substance use issues which may have impaired their parental capacity.

Parenting capacity evaluations follow RCW 13.34, Juvenile Court Act – Dependency and Termination of Parent-Child Relationship, specifically 13.34.180 subsection 1 and 13.34. 190 subsection 1b. Such evaluations provide estimates of the likelihood for conditions to be remedied so that the child can be returned to the parent and the parent’s ability to address parental deficiencies within the near future. Treatment recommendations or other “necessary services” to facilitate return of the examinee’s child are usually provided. The parent’s ability to benefit from such services is also estimated. Finally, if appropriate, opinions regarding the child’s best psychological interests are provided to assist the court.

Frequently, Dr. Freedman is asked to provide second opinion parental capacity evaluations. Such evaluations may be helpful to provide information to the court when conditions have changed or the initial evaluation provided insufficient or inaccurate information.

Parental capacity evaluations usually begin with an interview using a semi-structured format to collect information from the parent regarding their own history and their orientation to parenting. Dr. Freedman also uses a semi-structured interview to collect information about the parent’s current mental health function. Frequently Dr. Freedman will administer empirically validated parent related tests and will observe the parent and child together. Home visits are sometimes included as well. When there are questions regarding the effect of emotional or intellectual function on parenting capacity, empirically derived tests of function in these areas may be administered.

When conducting parental capacity evaluations Dr. Freedman reviews multiple forms of written documentation including pleadings and court orders, declarations or other written documentation from the parties or their advocates, written input from collateral sources, criminal or law enforcement history, school records, mental or physical health records, previous psychological or substance abuse evaluations and child protective service records among others. Dr. Freedman conducts interviews with collateral sources who know or have worked with the parent and the child, including family members, mental health providers, physicians, teachers, athletic coaches and religious leaders among others.

## Child Custody
The purpose of a child custody evaluation is to assist the court in determining the best interests of children involved in custody disputes and to assist in developing a parenting plan consistent with the requirements of RCW 26.09.184, 26.09.187, 26.09.191, and 26.09.220. Opinions also assist the court in decision making regarding modification of an existing parenting plan (RCW 26.09.260), relocation (RCW 26.09.520) or other specific issues.

Child custody evaluations are defined as “parenting evaluations” in Washington State as described in WAC 246-924-445. Such evaluations include a comparative analysis of the relative strength, nature, and stability of the child’s relationship with each parent, the history or parenting, each parent’s past and potential ability to perform parenting functions and the emotional needs and developmental level of the child. Other factors related to the child’s best interest and the ability if each parent to meet those interests are also assessed. Such factors include the child’s relationship with others, their involvement in activities or school and physical surroundings, the wishes of the parents or of a child who is sufficiently mature to express reasoned and independent preferences and each parent’s employment schedule. Allegations of substance abuse, mental illness, restrictive gatekeeping behaviors, child alienation, intimate partner violence as well as abusive or neglectful parenting are also assessed.

Child custody evaluations involve extensive interviews with each parent using structured and semi-structured protocols. Information related to each parent’s personal history, orientation to and history of parenting, current emotional function, and custodial preferences is collected over a series of interviews. If appropriate, Dr. Freedman administers empirically validated parent related tests and will schedule home visits at each parents’ home during their custodial time. When there are questions regarding the effect of emotional or intellectual function on parenting capacity, empirically derived tests of function in these areas may be administered.

When conducting child custody evaluations Dr. Freedman reviews multiple forms of written documentation including pleadings and court orders, declarations or other written documentation from the parties or their advocates, written input from collateral sources, criminal or law enforcement history, school records, mental or physical health records, previous psychological or substance abuse evaluations and child protective service records among others. Dr. Freedman conducts interviews with each child, often on multiple occasions and may administered additional psychological testing if there are specific child related issues which require further assessment to form opinions regarding the child’s best interest. Dr. Freedman also conducts interviews with collateral sources who know or have worked with each parent and the children, including family members, mental health providers, physicians, teachers, athletic coaches and religious leaders among others. The spouses or partners of parents are also interviewed. Depending on their level of involvement with the children, parents’ spouses or partners may also be asked to participate in further assessment or psychological testing.

## Parenting Evaluations of Individual Custody Litigants
