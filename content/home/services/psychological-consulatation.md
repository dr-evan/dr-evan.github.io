For example, Dr. Freedman consults with mental health professionals to prepare for testimony or deposition, respond to subpoenas and court orders or understand their role in legal proceedings. Dr. Freedman frequently consults with attorneys who believe that their client or case may involve a mental health issue. Such consultation may be helpful in determining the possible need for some form of forensic evaluation, to assist the attorney in most effectively representing their client or understanding their clientâ€™s needs. Dr. Freedman also consults with attorneys regarding psychological evaluations previously conducted by other psychologists. This type of consultation may be helpful in preparing for trial, considering a second opinion evaluation or understanding the opinions contained in the initial evaluation.
