An alternative dispute resolution process for separating or separated parents to help 
facilitate the best interests of the child.

<!--more-->

Parenting coordination is a quasi-legal, alternative dispute resolution process. The aim 
is to help separating or separated parents understand the best interests of their children 
and work together to achieve them. Parenting coordination combines assessment, education, 
case management and mediation. A parenting coordinator may also assist with decision making 
when so ordered by the court. Parenting coordination is child-focused and oriented to serve 
the best interests of the child or children. The objective of parenting coordination is to 
assist in the implementation of a parenting plan, monitor compliance with the plan, help 
resolve conflicts in a timely and cost effective manner, and to facilitate safe, healthy 
and meaningful parent-child relationships. The duties of a parent coordinator include 
providing parents with problem solving and conflict management services, monitoring 
compliance with court orders, and providing parents, attorneys, and the court with 
recommendations for new or modified parenting time provisions or mental health interventions.

Dr. Freedman applies his extensive background and training in forensic psychology, 
family law, mediation, child development and the effects of divorce to the field of 
parenting coordination. Parent coordination differs from psychotherapy and mediation: 
there is no therapist/client privilege, the process is not confidential, and medical 
insurance will not reimburse for parenting coordination.
